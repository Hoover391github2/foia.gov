## Explore data from Annual FOIA Reports

Annual Reports shine a light on agencies' administration of the FOIA by providing members of the public with detailed FOIA statistics. Users can filter data by agency, data type, and fiscal year. Users can also compare data across years and agencies. Annual Report data is displayed as a chart on FOIA.gov and can also be downloaded as a CSV file.  For full data sets from agency Annual Reports, please visit [the Developer page](https://www.foia.gov/developer/).

## Explore data from Quarterly FOIA Reports

FOIA.gov provides a more real-time picture of agency FOIA administration through its display of Quarterly Report data. Each quarter, agencies must provide the number of requests received, processed, and in the agency's backlog. Additionally, agencies must report the status of the agency's ten oldest pending requests each quarter. Users can filter data by agency, data type, and quarter. Quarterly Report data is displayed as a chart on FOIA.gov and can also be downloaded as a CSV file.
